        "* Vectors can be interpreted geometrically as either points or directions in space.\n",
        "* Dot products define the notion of angle to arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "* Hyperplanes are high-dimensional generalizations of lines and planes.  They can be used to define decision planes that are often used as the last step in a classification task.\n",
        "* Matrix multiplication can be geometrically interpreted as uniform distortions of the underlying coordinates. They represent a very restricted, but mathematically clean, way to transform vectors.\n",
        "* Linear dependence is a way to tell when a collection of vectors are in a lower dimensional space than we would expect (say you have $3$ vectors living in a $2$-dimensional space). The rank of a matrix is the size of the largest subset of its columns that are linearly independent.\n",
        "* When a matrix's inverse is defined, matrix inversion allows us to find another matrix that undoes the action of the first.\n",
        "* Tensor contractions and Einstein summation provide for a neat and clean notation for expressing many of the computations that are seen in machine learning.\n"
