Let's do a whirlwind tour through computer hardware:\n","\n","- **CPU**: \"central command\" of the computer -- this is the part that issues commands to the various other components of a computer (disk/RAM/GPU/DSP...). Much of the communications between parts of the computer require the CPU to act as a coordinator. CPUs are excellent at performing long-serieses of complicated commands and can run parallel code if they are multi-core (although doing the latter with Vanilla Python isn't possible)\n","- **GPU**: \"graphics\" unit of the computer -- this used to be just the part that was responsible for rendering things to your monitor. But it turns out the underlying ability that enables this rendering is pretty extensible to other tasks as well, specifically doing many, *many* matrix multiplies in parallel. This is why GPUs are preferred for training and running neural networks\n","- **TPU**: \"tensor\" unit -- this is a very recent addition to the computer HW family. GPUs are still heavily used for a variety of tasks (still being responsible for rendering objects to screen, which is most heavily used in things like video games), so they aren't *specifically* made for deep learning. They just happen to be a pretty decent fit. TPUs were built for the *sole* purpose of accelerating ML training, so they are much more finely tuned to this use case\n","\n","That being said, there is one new Terminal command you should keep in mind for this: `nvidia-smi`. This shows you:\n","\n","1. If you have a/multiple GPUs on your computer and\n","2. How much those GPUs are being used\n","\n","Let's see how this looks in practice!
